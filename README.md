# DigiDraw
We are a website that makes your needs easier. By automatically cropping your image through a simple scan, we digitalize your art and signatures, and have the ability to edit the colors of your drawings!
# How to Go about it?
Configuring it is easy! You can download the code we have provided. You will then need to head to your terminal(in case of windows, please use an IDE such as PyCharm). Now, in your terminal, you can type "ls" to see different directories. Find the one you have saved the code in and type "cd {directory name}". If there is a further set of directories, find the sub-directory and repeat the "cd" command. Once in the directory of the file, type "python canvas.py". If this command gives an error, please use "python3 canvas.py".
